# HyperFrames Student Kit

Nate Herk's reusable video-editing kit for **Codex and Claude Code**.
Bring your own footage. Cut dead air, review mistakes, plan the story, and build
motion graphics with HyperFrames and GSAP.

## Examples

Four finished videos made with this kit.

### YouTube motion showreel

Made with the `motion-showreel` skill: 15 seconds, 1920x1080, 60fps, cut to a
129 BPM grid. The red scrubber dot travels through seven craft chapters and
lands as the play button in the logo.

The three short-form videos below were created by Nate. Press Play on any video

## What's included

- **15 skills**, mirrored for both assistants, with their helper scripts and references.
- **406 draft motion-graphics cards** across two styles, with manifests, CSS tokens, and editable slots.
- **Two scene templates:** dark graph paper and a left glass popout.
- Transcription, silence cutting, mistake detection, reviewed cut rendering,
  transcript retiming, EDL review, beat-sync validation, and preflight tools.
- **Short-form editing:** reels, YouTube Shorts, hook and payoff planning, precise captions, moving B-roll, and audio review.
- **12 existing teaching projects** preserved from the original student kit.
- A synthetic starter composition and editing fixture that need no footage or API key.

## Tools and optional services

**Nate uses ElevenLabs Scribe to transcribe and Kie.ai to generate videos and
image assets.** Bring your own API keys and credits when using those services.
You can ask the assistant to use OpenAI Whisper or local Whisper instead, or
supply an existing word-level transcript. Generated assets are optional.

The local starter needs no paid transcription or generation API. See the
[tools, accounts, and API-key guide](docs/TOOLS-AND-API-KEYS.md) for required tools,
optional services, setup details, and prompts you can copy.

## Install

Install Node.js **22 or newer**, Git, FFmpeg (including ffprobe), and Chrome or
Chromium. Make `node`, `ffmpeg`, and `ffprobe` available in your terminal.
Then run these commands in PowerShell, macOS Terminal, or a Linux shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nateherkai/hyperframes-student-kit.git
cd hyperframes-student-kit
npm ci
npm run setup
npm test
```

Setup checks the tools and creates `.env` only if it is absent. Add only the keys
for services you choose. The included transcription helper uses ElevenLabs;
Whisper and Kie.ai integrations need the setup described in the
[tools guide](docs/TOOLS-AND-API-KEYS.md). [Setup and troubleshooting](docs/SETUP.md).

## Render your first example

```sh
npm run demo
cd video-projects/demo
npx hyperframes lint
npx hyperframes preview
```

Scrub the eight-second animation in Studio. After reviewing it, stop the preview
with Ctrl+C, then render:

```sh
npx hyperframes render --quality draft --output renders/demo.mp4
```

The demo uses local GSAP. HyperFrames may download and cache its font substitutions on the first render. It has no voiceover. The separate
[synthetic transcript](examples/editing/source.json) exercises the cutting tools;
it is fictional test data, not a transcript of the title animation.

## Edit your footage

Open this repository folder in Codex or Claude Code and say:

> Use edit-video to edit my recording at [local path]. Keep my examples and core
> lessons. Tighten dead air, show me the proposed mistake cuts, and use the dark
> graph-paper style with occasional glass cards. Produce a reviewed draft.

Codex: `$edit-video`. Claude Code: `/edit-video`. For a single operation use
`cut-silences`, `cut-mistakes`, `video-storytelling`, or `style-library`.
See the [step-by-step workflow](docs/WORKFLOW.md), [prompt recipes](docs/PROMPTS.md),
and [storytelling workbook](docs/STORYTELLING-WORKBOOK.md).

## Create a reel or YouTube Short

> Use short-form-edit to turn my recording at [local path] into a 9:16 reel.
> Build a truthful hook and payoff, preserve my meaning, tighten mistakes, and
> add precise captions, purposeful moving footage, and sound design. Prepare
> a draft for review. Use my existing footage before proposing generated assets.

Codex: `$short-form-edit`. Claude Code: `/short-form-edit`.
The skill includes planning references and validators for caption timing, source
mapping, scene coverage, and footage reuse. It is an agent-guided workflow;
review the actual motion and audio before publishing.
[Short-form walkthrough and validation commands](docs/SHORT-FORM.md).

## Make a motion-design showreel

> Use motion-showreel to make a 15-second showreel for [brand]. Study my reference
> reel at [local path] if I give one. Pick one motif that transforms through every
> chapter, cut on the music's beat grid, and end on the logo. Show me the storyboard
> and beat sheet before building, and confirm before any paid music or asset generation.

Codex: `$motion-showreel`. Claude Code: `/motion-showreel`.
The skill includes a measured breakdown of the reel it was built from, a chapter
technique library, a HUD template, and Node tools to analyze a reference video,
measure a music take's beat grid, splice it onto the cut grid, and premix sound effects.

## Existing examples and migration

This is the main student-kit repository. The newer video-pipeline kit has been
merged here with both Git histories preserved. The original 12 projects remain
in `video-projects/`, alongside the original shared brand examples and the
`make-a-video`, `short-form-video`, and `website-to-hyperframes` skills.
Use `short-form-edit` for new reels; `short-form-video` documents the older May
Shorts compositions. [Migration and compatibility notes](docs/MIGRATION.md).

The cards are reusable **draft assets**. Test the cards you choose with your text
and footage. Library templates may load GSAP and Google Fonts from their public
CDNs; localize these dependencies when assembling a final project.

The three showcase videos were explicitly supplied for public sharing. No other
private recordings, transcripts, credentials, or private workspace settings were
imported. Previously public examples remain in the repository. New folders
under `video-projects/` and `raw-media/` are ignored automatically; files already
tracked by Git remain tracked. Create a new project for your own footage.
